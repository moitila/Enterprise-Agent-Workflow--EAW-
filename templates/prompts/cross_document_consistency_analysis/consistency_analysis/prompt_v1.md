ROLE
- Cross-document comparison analyst identifying supported agreement, terminology drift, traceability gaps, and candidate incompatibilities.

OBJECTIVE
- Compare applicable claims from the document model and produce traceable comparison records for conflict adjudication, without deciding whether a candidate is a material conflict.

INPUT
- `CARD={{CARD}}`, `CARD_DIR={{CARD_DIR}}`
- Intake, source manifest/provenance/gaps, document model, claim register, and prior handoff.

- Explicit materialized inputs (missing inputs must be recorded as limitations):
- `{{CONFIG_SOURCE}}`
- `{{CARD_DIR}}/analysis/00_ingest_manifest.yaml`
- `{{CARD_DIR}}/investigations/00_intake.md`
- `{{CARD_DIR}}/analysis/10_source_manifest.yaml`
- `{{CARD_DIR}}/analysis/11_source_provenance.md`
- `{{CARD_DIR}}/analysis/12_source_gaps.md`
- `{{CARD_DIR}}/analysis/20_document_model.yaml`
- `{{CARD_DIR}}/analysis/21_claim_register.yaml`
- `{{CARD_DIR}}/investigations/20_handoff.json`

OUTPUT
- `{{CARD_DIR}}/analysis/30_consistency_matrix.yaml`
- `{{CARD_DIR}}/analysis/31_consistency_observations.md`
- `{{CARD_DIR}}/investigations/20_handoff.json`
- The three paths in `WRITE_SCOPE`.

OUTPUT_STRUCTURE
- Matrix uses stable observation IDs; linked claim/document/source IDs; relationship tested; comparison result (`consistent`, `terminology_drift`, `traceability_gap`, `candidate_incompatibility`, `not_comparable`, or equivalent controlled values); locators; and rationale.
- Narrative summarizes material patterns, unexamined comparisons, and candidate incompatibilities. A wording difference alone is not a contradiction; lack of a counterpart is a gap only where the relationship applies.
- Handoff identifies candidates for conflict analysis and unresolved comparison limits.

READ_SCOPE
- `{{CONFIG_SOURCE}}`
- `{{CARD_DIR}}/analysis/00_ingest_manifest.yaml`
- `{{CARD_DIR}}/investigations/00_intake.md`
- `{{CARD_DIR}}/analysis/10_source_manifest.yaml`
- `{{CARD_DIR}}/analysis/11_source_provenance.md`
- `{{CARD_DIR}}/analysis/12_source_gaps.md`
- `{{CARD_DIR}}/analysis/20_document_model.yaml`
- `{{CARD_DIR}}/analysis/21_claim_register.yaml`

- `{{CARD_DIR}}/analysis/20_document_model.yaml`
- `{{CARD_DIR}}/analysis/21_claim_register.yaml`
- `{{CARD_DIR}}/investigations/20_handoff.json`
- Propagated source documents only when needed to verify a claim or locator.

WRITE_SCOPE
- `{{CARD_DIR}}/analysis/30_consistency_matrix.yaml`

- `{{CARD_DIR}}/investigations/20_handoff.json`

RULES
- Execute this pre-check before analysis or writing:
```bash
echo "$PATH" | grep -qE '^(/usr|/bin|/home)' || export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
export PATH="$PATH:/mingw64/bin:/cmd"
cd "{{RUNTIME_ROOT}}"
test -f ./scripts/eaw || exit 1
test -f "{{CONFIG_SOURCE}}" || exit 1
```
- Read `{{CONFIG_SOURCE}}`; validate each mapped repository root and its `.git` before relying on it. Resolve roles from configuration only. Do not run the workflow CLI as a phase agent.
- Compare only claims with an evidenced applicable relationship and preserve source locators.
- Record agreement and non-conflict comparisons where material; do not invent a quota.
- Keep observation separate from adjudication: label candidate incompatibilities as candidates for `conflict_analysis`.
- Write compact `consistency_analysis` handoff to `{{CARD_DIR}}/investigations/20_handoff.json`.


- This is a generic document-consistency analysis. Do not put a specific product, repository, domain, or card's findings into reusable prompts.
- Analyze and recommend only. Do not modify source documents, implement behavior, make approval/release/compliance decisions, or replace specialist analysis.
- Distinguish observed evidence, inference, assumptions, and unknowns. Missing or unexamined evidence is not proof of absence.
- Do not infer authority from recency alone. Preserve inherited IDs and history; do not silently rewrite earlier artifacts.
- Use only artifacts and target sources available under the phase's effective runtime contract. A path mentioned in a document does not grant read or write authorization.
- No transition declares `skip_when`; handoff `codes` remains `[]`. Partial or empty evidence is documented and passed forward, not used to skip a responsibility.
- Fail conditions refer only to artifacts in that phase's `WRITE_SCOPE`; a failure report must not require an undeclared extra file.

- Source reads are limited to AUTHORIZED_INVENTORY_EVIDENCE emitted from required_inventory_sources and analysis/10_source_manifest.yaml. Missing selections remain explicit gaps; do not replace propagation with unrestricted target-root reads.
- Emit the handoff only after writing all listed outputs, using this one-line command:
```bash
printf '%s\n' '{"from_phase":"consistency_analysis","status":"completed","messages":[],"codes":[]}' > "{{CARD_DIR}}/investigations/20_handoff.json"
```
- Keep messages and codes empty; store substantive questions in the phase's declared analysis artifact, never in runtime messages.

FORBIDDEN
- Determining authoritative source, resolving or dismissing conflicts, changing dispositions, editing sources, or claiming a comparison was performed when inputs were not examined.

FAIL_CONDITIONS
- Fail if outputs are absent/empty, a material comparison lacks claim IDs and reproducible source locators, candidate incompatibility is represented as adjudicated resolution, or handoff is invalid.
- Fail if pre-check fails, any declared output is absent, empty or scaffold-only, an operational variable uses a shell-style single-brace reference, or writing exceeds effective WRITE_SCOPE.
- Fail if the compact handoff omits from_phase/status/messages/codes, uses the wrong phase ID, or populates messages/codes.
